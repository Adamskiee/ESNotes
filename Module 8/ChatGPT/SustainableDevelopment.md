This passage explains that **true development** is not just about **economic growth**, but about using that growth to improve people's **quality of life**. Letâ€™s break it down simply:

---
### ðŸ’¡ **Main Idea:**

To live a **better life**, we need to consider three interconnected factors:

1. **Social factors** (like education, healthcare, equality)
    
2. **Economic factors** (like jobs, income, and access to resources)
    
3. **Environmental factors** (like clean air, water, land, and natural resources)
    

These must work **together** to create real development.

### ðŸ’° **What about Economic Growth (GNP)?**

- **GNP per capita** = The total value of goods and services a country produces, divided by its population.
    
- When GNP **increases**, it means the **economy is growing**.
    

However, the passage says:

> ðŸ”¸ **Economic growth is not development** in itself.  
> ðŸ”¸ But itâ€™s a very **important tool** for achieving development.

Why? Because:

- GNP is just a **bundle of goods and services** that people can use or consume.
    
- If people have **more income** (due to growth), they can buy more of what they **need** â€” like food, education, healthcare, housing, etc.
    
- This helps people **gain the abilities and opportunities** that define a better life.

### ðŸ§  In short:

- Development = improving peopleâ€™s lives in many ways (not just money).
    
- Economic growth = a way to help that happen, **if** it leads to better living conditions and more freedom of choice.
