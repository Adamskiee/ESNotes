Sustainability runs parallel and supports the prevailing natural laws and principles such as¬†
- the finiteness of our resources including vital energy sources,
- the balance of nature, and¬†
- symbiosis between plants and animals including man.¬†

In environmental science, we study how humans survive‚Äîand that survival depends on having our basic needs met, like:
- Food  
- Water  
- Clean air  
- Usable land  
- A stable climate

![[Pasted image 20250408145858.png]] 
Physiological Needs (the bottom of the pyramid)
These are the **most basic needs for human survival**, like:
- Food üçö
- Water üíß
- Air üå¨Ô∏è
- Shelter üè†
- Sleep üò¥
> **Environmental science focuses on protecting the natural systems (ecosystems) that provide these basic physiological needs.**

#### **Sustainability started as a physical and biological concept**
>In the past, sustainability mainly meant using **natural resources** (like forests, fish, and groundwater) in a way that **doesn‚Äôt go beyond their natural ability to renew**.
#### **Then it expanded to include social, physical, and economic management.**
>Now, sustainability also includes **how we manage resources** through laws, policies, and good practices to keep things balanced over time.
#### **Today, sustainability includes environmental, social, and economic aspects.**
>It‚Äôs no longer just about physical limits. It‚Äôs also about **how human activity affects nature, people, and the economy** together.


# The concept of Development
>Development is not just about having more money or buildings.  
>It‚Äôs about having a **lasting ability to live a better life** ‚Äî a life with dignity, opportunity, and well-being.

It includes two main capacities:
>1. **The capacity ‚Äúto be‚Äù** ‚Äì this means having the conditions to live well:
- **To be educated** üéì ‚Äì access to learning and knowledge
- **To be healthy and well-nourished** ü•óüè• ‚Äì having good food, water, and healthcare
- **To be secure** üõ°Ô∏è ‚Äì living without fear of harm, violence, or extreme hardship
>2. **The capacity ‚Äúto do‚Äù** ‚Äì this means being able to take part in life actively:
- **To work productively and creatively** üíºüé®
- **To participate in community life** üèòÔ∏è ‚Äì like decision-making, volunteering, or helping others
- **To have a family (if desired)** üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß ‚Äì the ability to raise children responsibly
- **To explore opportunities** ‚úàÔ∏è ‚Äì traveling or moving for jobs, education, or better living conditions
It means that **true development should last long-term** and not harm future generations.  
So **sustainable development** is:
> ‚Äú*Improving quality of life today without destroying the resources or opportunities for tomorrow.*‚Äù

## It breaks development down into **three main objectives**, which help define what people need for a meaningful and sustainable life.
1. **Access to basic life-sustaining goods**
Development should ensure that **everyone has enough to survive and stay healthy**
2. **A higher level of living**
This refers to **quality of life**, not just survival.
3. **Freedom and choice**
True development also means giving people the **freedom to make their own choices**

## To live a **better life**, we need to consider three interconnected factors:
1. **Social factors** (like education, healthcare, equality)
2. **Economic factors** (like jobs, income, and access to resources)
3. **Environmental factors** (like clean air, water, land, and natural resources)
These must work **together** to create real development.
- Development = improving people‚Äôs lives in many ways (not just money).
- Economic growth = a way to help that happen, **if** it leads to better living conditions and more freedom of choice.

## Achieving a better life isn‚Äôt just about growing the economy ‚Äî it‚Äôs also about changing how society works, thinks, and treats its people. And while tradition, religion, or politics may affect development, they can **adapt over time** to support a better future.

What constitutes a **"better life"** can vary depending on the person, their needs, and the **societal context** they are in.
The **context** ‚Äî whether you're in a developed or developing country ‚Äî influences these needs.
**Developed countries** focus more on environmental and social issues because they‚Äôve already met their basic needs.
**Developing countries** focus more on **economic growth** and fulfilling **basic needs** first.

# Measuring Development
### **Traditional Ideas of Development**
- **Focus**: Production-driven development.
- **Key Factors**:
    - Credit, machinery, exports, imports.
    - Competitiveness in the global market.
### **GNP as a Measure of Development**
- **GNP** = Total output of goods and services.
- **Limitations of GNP**:
    - Does not reflect social benefits.
    - Ignores costs of production and environmental impact.
    - Hides inequalities within the country.
### **Example of GNP Limitations**
- **Saudi Arabia**:
    - High GDP per capita.
    - Large gap between the rich and the poor.
### **Growth vs. Development**
- **Growth**:
    - Increase in production/output.
    - Short-term focus.
- **Development**:
    - Long-term sustainability.
    - Continuous adjustments to changing situations.
    - Stability in growth process.

## The Sustainable Development Paradigm
### **Shift in Economic Development Paradigm**
- **Change**: From exploitative development to **sustainable development**.
- **Sustainability**: Focus on **lasting** and **continuing** development.
### **Twin Pillars of Sustainable Development**
1. **Respect for People**: Improving the quality of life (health, education, rights, freedom from violence).
2. **Respect for Ecosystems**: Conserving the planet‚Äôs vitality and diversity.
### **Conditions for Sustainable Development**
- **Improve Human Life Quality**: Through economic growth, health, education, political freedom.
- **Conserve Ecosystem Vitality**: Protect the structure, function, and diversity of ecosystems.
### **Measures for Sustainability**
1. **Conservation of Life Support Systems**:
    - Biogeochemical cycles, recycling of elements, air/water/land regulation.
2. **Conservation of Biological Diversity**:
    - Flora, fauna, microorganisms, and ecosystems.
3. **Sustainable Use of Resources**:
    - Forests, agricultural lands, marine/freshwater, wildlife resources.
4. **Stay Within Earth's Carrying Capacity**:
    - Control production, consumption, and waste.
### **Achieving Sustainable Development**
- **Integrate Socio-Economic & Ecological Perspectives**.
- **Policies, Plans, and Programs** must align for sustainability.
### **WCED‚Äôs Definition of Sustainable Development**
- **‚ÄúDevelopment that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.‚Äù**
### **Integrating Objectives for Sustainability**
- **Economic, Social, and Environmental Objectives** must align.
- **Avoid future degradation** of resources and environment.
- **Ensure future generations are not worse off**.

## Dimensions
### **The Economic Dimension of Sustainable Development**
- Focuses on **production**, **consumption** of economic goods, and the provision of economic services.
- **Traditional Development**: Measured by increased profits and income.
- **Goal**: Increase economic welfare without limiting future possibilities.
- **Key Actions**:
    - Maximize productivity.
    - Promote the use of **recycled products**.
    - Ensure **equitable access to resources**, especially for the poor.
### **The Social Dimension of Sustainable Development**
- **Goal**: Improve **health care**, **education**, and **social well-being**.
- **People-centered** development: For the **well-being of individuals**, not just economic growth.
- **Indigenous strategies**: E.g., **Igorot‚Äôs sustainable shifting cultivation** and **family farm management** systems.
- **Focus**: Identify and remove hindrances that prevent people from meeting their needs.
    - These may be **social**, **cultural**, or **educational** barriers.
- **Empowerment**: Local communities should have a say in decisions affecting their lives and resources.
### **The Environmental Dimension of Sustainable Development**
- **Goal**: Protect natural resources like **soils**, **woodlots**, and **fisheries**.
- **Efficient use** of **arable lands** and **water supplies** to meet the needs of a growing population.
- **Renewable resources**: Use in ways that maintain their ability to regenerate (e.g., soil, underground water, biomass).
- **Resource management**: Ensure long-term **sustainability** and avoid depletion.
    - Development activities like **land clearing**, **oil drilling**, and **dam building** should not deplete natural resources.

## **Integrating the Three Dimensions**
- Sustainable development requires a **balance** between **economic growth**, **social well-being**, and **environmental protection**.    
- Development **should not compromise** future generations' ability to meet their needs.
