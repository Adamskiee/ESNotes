## 📘 **6.1 Population Ecology**

### 📌 **Definition**

- **Population Ecology**: Study of populations and how they interact with the environment.
    
- Populations are affected by **density, distribution, age structure**, and **size**.
    

### 📈 **Population Dynamics**

- Population changes = (Births + Immigration) – (Deaths + Emigration).
    
- **Dispersion Patterns**:
    
    - **Clumped** (most common) – grouped near resources.
        
    - **Uniform** – evenly spaced.
        
    - **Random** – no predictable pattern.
        

### 🧩 **Factors Affecting Population**

- **Density-dependent**: Effect increases with population (e.g., disease).
    
- **Density-independent**: Environmental (e.g., natural disasters).
    

### 💧 **Resource Availability**

- **Exponential Growth (J-curve)**: Fast, unlimited growth.
    
- **Logistic Growth (S-curve)**: Growth slows near **carrying capacity (K)**.
    

### 🧬 **Life-History Patterns**

- **r-strategists**: Small, fast-reproducing (e.g., insects).
    
- **K-strategists**: Large, slow-reproducing (e.g., mammals).
    

### 🌡 **Environmental Conditions**

- Seasons, climate, disasters affect population trends.
    

### 🔁 **Organism Interactions**

- **Positive**: Cooperation, mutualism.
    
- **Negative**: Predation, competition, territoriality.
    
- **Stress** from crowding can reduce survival and reproduction.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **6.2 Human Population**

### 🌍 **Global Growth Trends**

- Historically **exponential (J-curve)**, now transitioning to **logistic (S-curve)**.
    
- Current: ~7.5 billion; predicted ~9 billion by 2050.
    

### 🔄 **Population Revolutions**

1. **Neolithic Revolution** – Agriculture began; permanent settlements.
    
2. **Industrial Revolution** – Fossil fuels and machines increased productivity.
    
3. **Medical Revolution** – Reduced death rates (e.g., vaccines, sanitation).
    
4. **Green Revolution** – Boosted agriculture via fertilizers, high-yield crops.
    
5. **Environmental Revolution** – Shift to sustainable practices (solar, wind, etc.).
    

### 🧮 **Demographic Transition Model**

1. **Pre-Transition**: High birth & death rates (primitive stability).
    
2. **Early Transition**: Falling death rates; rapid growth.
    
3. **Late Transition**: Falling birth rates; slowing growth.
    
4. **Post-Transition**: Low birth & death rates; stability.
    
5. **Possible 5th Stage**: Birth rate < death rate → population decline.
    

### 🧓 **Age Structure**

- Age pyramids show future trends:
    
    - **Broad base**: Rapid growth (developing countries).
        
    - **Top-heavy**: Aging population (developed countries).

## 🌱 **Sustainability Concepts**

### 🏞 **Carrying Capacity**

- Max population an environment can sustain.
    
- Unclear for humans due to technology and adaptability.
    
- **Julian Simon**: Human ingenuity expands carrying capacity.
    

### 🦶 **Ecological Footprint**

- Measures land and water needed per person for resources and waste.
    
- Sustainable limit: ~1.7 ha/person.
    
- Current use: 1.6x more than nature can replenish.

## 💰 **Economy & Population**

- **World Bank Categories**:
    
    - **High-income**: Developed (e.g., US, Japan).
        
    - **Middle-income**: Moderately developed (e.g., China, Indonesia).
        
    - **Low-income**: Developing (e.g., India, many African nations).
        
- 98% of population growth occurs in developing countries.
    

---

## 🌏 **Sustainable Future**

- **Developed countries**: Reduce overconsumption and waste.
    
- **Developing countries**: Stabilize population, improve quality of life.
    
- Shared responsibility in environmental stewardship.
