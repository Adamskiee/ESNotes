## 🌊 **Water Resources**

### Importance

- Water is a vital renewable resource recycled through the water cycle.
    
- Freshwater is essential for agriculture, industry, and drinking.
    
- Saltwater isn’t usable for most human needs due to high salinity.
    

### Sources

- **Surface Water:** Rivers, lakes, wetlands.
    
- **Groundwater:** Stored in pores of soil and rocks.
    
- In the Philippines: ~18 major river basins, 79 lakes, 50,000 km² groundwater reservoir.
    

### Usage

- High water consumption in agriculture and industry.
    
- Example: 1 lb beef = 800 gallons of water.
    

### Threats

- Pollution (point source like factories; non-point like urban runoff).
    
- Over-extraction and contamination.
    
- Climate-induced shortages.
    

### Management Strategies

- Groundwater regulation.
    
- Recycling and water-saving technologies.
    
- Clean Water Act (RA 9275) regulates water quality by usage classification.

## 🐾 **Wildlife & Biodiversity**

### Significance

- Biodiversity ensures ecosystem stability and provides food, medicine, and raw materials.
    
- Wild species play ecological roles (e.g., nutrient recycling, climate regulation).
    

### Threats

- Habitat loss, deforestation, mining.
    
- Overhunting, poaching (e.g., African elephant decline).
    
- Invasive species (alien species introduced by humans).
    
- Coral reef destruction (e.g., cyanide fishing, muro-ami).
    

### In the Philippines

- Endangered: Philippine Eagle, Tamaraw.
    
- High number of threatened endemic bird species.
    

### Management

- **Conservation types:**
    
    - **In situ:** In natural habitats (e.g., parks).
        
    - **Ex situ:** Outside natural habitat (e.g., zoos, gene banks).
        
- **Wildlife conservation programs:**
    
    - National parks, GRBS areas, NIPAS Law (RA 7586).
        
    - Gene banks for seeds and endangered species.
        

### Legal Framework

- **Main Laws:**
    
    - 1988 Philippine Environment Code
        
    - 1992 NIPAS Act
        
    - 2001 Wildlife Resources Conservation & Protection Act
        
    - 2006 EO No. 578 (National Biodiversity Strategy)
