## 📗 **7.3 ECO-INNOVATION**

### 🌱 Environmental Technologies

- Solutions to reduce environmental impact.
    
- **Types**:
    
    - **End-of-pipe**: Treats pollution after it’s created (e.g., wastewater treatment, catalytic converters).
        
    - **Clean production**: Prevents pollution from being created—more efficient and less costly.
        

---

### 🛠️ Product and Service Innovation

- **Product examples**: Green buildings, greenhouses.
    
- **Service examples**: Environmental consulting, waste management.
    
- Benefits: Reduced raw material use, carbon emissions, and pollution.
    

---

### 🏢 Green Buildings

- Eco-friendly buildings focus on energy efficiency, water management, air quality, and green materials.
    
- Uses **LEED** (U.S.) or **BERDE** (Philippines) rating systems.
    
- Benefits:
    
    - Healthier and more productive environments.
        
    - Lower energy bills and emissions.
        
    - Reduced construction waste.

### ⚡ Green System Innovation

#### ✅ Renewable Energy

- Reduces carbon emissions; includes **solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, hydropower**.
    
- Encouraged by the **Renewable Energy Act**.
    
- Philippines has high potential due to natural resources.
    

#### 🐠 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)

- Coral reefs/seagrass beds support biodiversity and fisheries.
    
- MPAs promote fish population "spillover" into buffer zones.
    
- 1,557 MPAs in the Philippines—the highest in Southeast Asia.
    

#### 🌳 Green Buffer Zones

- Mangroves reduce erosion, pollution, storm surges, and noise.
    

#### 🌾 Agroforestry

- Combines agriculture + forestry.
    
- Reduces erosion, enhances soil, provides biodiversity and crop security.

### 🏭 Organizational Innovation

#### ✅ Environmental Management System (EMS)

- A framework for reducing environmental impact in businesses.
    
- Covers: Waste, emissions, energy, materials, transport.
    
- Based on **Deming Cycle**: Plan → Do → Check → Act.
    
- ISO 14001: A globally recognized EMS certification.
    
    - Applicable to any organization or industry.
        
    - Improves environmental performance and reputation.
